This code builds a 5-way B-Tree using randomly generated keys. 
You should run the program by inputting make run to the terminal and make clean after you have ran the code. 
When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a value for N. After it will output (a) which is the tree in inorder traversal and then (b) which is the array of keys found.
The code builds the B-tree while generating the keys. In the main function, keys are generated one by one, and as each key is generated, it is immediately inserted into the B-tree. The B-tree is constructed incrementally as keys are generated, maintaining the tree's balance throughout the process.

This code defines a struct called TreeNode to represent nodes in the BST. 
It includes functions to build a balanced BST from a sorted vector of integers and find the k-th smallest element in the BST. 
You should run the program by inputting make run to the terminal and make clean after you have ran the code. 
When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a value for k and then display the k-th smallest element in the BST and the elements of the BST in ascending order.

Running the Python and Perl sort files are very easy and I will walk you through it:

First, for running the python file "sort.py", all you have to input is: "python3 sort.py" and click the enter button.  
Python3 in front of the file name is necessary as the program will not work without it. It defines which verison of Python you want 
to use to run the program. 

For running the Perl file, you will need to input "perl sort.pl" and click the enter button. 
Including the word "perl" in front is neccessary as the program will not work without it. The program will not allow you to run the code using "./sort.pl" 
based on the shebang line. So it is neccessary to type "perl" before inputing the program name along with it in order for the program to run.  

Please click the enter button after you have inputed the correct command coresponding to the type of file.
The program should now start running and will ask you for a value. Enter a number and click the enter button. 
The program will ask you 9 more numbers and please input these numbers and click enter after each one. 
Once 10 numbers have been inputed, the program will output a list of all the unsorted numbers and below it will be 
the sorted number list. The program is now over.

# SP23-IN-CSCI-24000 COMPUTING II: 21457 CSCI24000 
# **Course Description**
This course focuses on the progress of computer science and programming from the simplest early languages through modern object-oriented languages. Students will gain fluency in at least three programming languages, from standard C through C++ to Java. The course then looks beyond specific programming languages towards a view of computing as a data science. You will investigate essential data structures and algorithms, which will truly begin your journey as a computer scientist.

    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>I want to create an interactive HTML page for a gas station where customers can choose gas grade, checkout food items, and browse a local map and attractions.</p>
    <h2>Reason for Choosing This Topic</h2>
      <p>I chose this topic because my Father has a gas station and it would be nice to make a webpage for practice if I ever want to create one for him. It won't be necessarily the same but it will have many features I can use. </p>
      <p> I decided to use a local gas station name from my home town called Kum & Go. </p>
    <h2>Background Knowledge</h2>
      <p>I have gone over some of my background regarding why I chose the topic but I have knowledge of HTML and Javascript from my other classes. Also I have knowledge of what services are provided in a real life gas station. </p>
    <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
      <p>The intended audience for this website is a customer looking to purchase gas or food. Also someone looking for directions. There are no limitations to who is  or is not the intended audience</p>

 
    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a rough draft of each page: March 16, 2024</li>
      <li>Create a flowchart for each page and gather images: March 16, 2024 </li>

      <li>Finalize & validate all the HTML files including the CSS: April 18, 2024</li>

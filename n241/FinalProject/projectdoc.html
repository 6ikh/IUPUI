    <h1>Wireframe and Sitemap</h1>

    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>My interactive HTML page for a gas station will let customers choose gas grade, checkout food items, and browse a local map and attractions. </p>
      <p>The purpose of the site is to create an interactive way for customers to shop and look at information at a gas station. Compared to many gas station examples, it may not look the same and have all the fancy functionality but it will be simple enough to understand and follow through. </p>
      <p>I can create the site as interactive and easy to interact for the consumer to have a quick time doing business with the gas station. The purpose of the webpage is to be an example for a real life webpage I could use for my father's business. It will be good practice to simulate the functionality of a gas station on the webpage. The format of each section will be like such: </p>

    <h2> Gas Purchasing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This section features a user-friendly interface where customers can easily select their desired gas grade and specify the quantity they want to purchase.</li>
        <li>Customers are provided with options to pay using two methods which are credit/debit cards or cash at the station.</li>
        <li>The interface is easy and responsive, allowing customers to complete their transactions quickly and efficiently. Features include a fuel price calculator & real-time updates on fuel availability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Snacks and Products</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This section showcases the variety of products available inside the gas station's convenience store, including snacks, beverages, automotive supplies, and other essentials.</li>
        <li>Customers can browse through different categories of products, view detailed descriptions, and see images. Each product listing includes information such as price and availability.</li>
        <li> The customer can select products and quanities to purchase at the cash register.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sightseeing and Attractions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This section provides information about nearby sightseeing spots, attractions, and points of interest.</li>
        <li>Customers can explore interactive maps, read descriptions of each attraction, and access additional resources such as directions, hours of operation, and contact information.</li>
        <li>Photos of each attractions give the user a better understanding of the environment. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Needs Analysis</h2>
      <p>The idea of a user interface is keeping it clean and simple for the consumer. The display must be easy to navigate and show appealing colors to keep the user engaged.</p>
      <p>I want to create the webpage in a way that each feature is clearly defined and the webpage must be user friendly with the sections:</p>
      <p>People usually dont spend more than 10 minutes at a gas station anyways so I aim to keep the shopping process short as well.</p>

    <h2>Gas Purchasing Section</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Clear Fuel Selection: The site needs to offer a straightforward interface for selecting gas grades and specifying quantities, ensuring customers can complete transactions quickly and efficiently. </li>
        <li> Flexible Payment Options: Offering various payment methods such as credit/debit cards and cash caters to customers' preferences, enhancing convenience and satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Snacks and Products Section</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Detailed Product Information: Providing detailed descriptions, prices, and availability  ensures customers can make informed purchasing decisions. </li>
        <li> Diverse Product Showcase: The site needs to showcase the variety of products available in the convenience store, allowing customers to easily browse through different categories. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sightseeing and Attractions Section</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Comprehensive Information: The site needs to provide comprehensive information about nearby sightseeing spots and attractions, including descriptions, directions, hours of operation, and contact details. </li>
        <li> Visual Representation: Incorporating photos helps customers visualize and plan their visits effectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>The goal is to create a simple gas station webpage for a customer to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select any gas grade and purchase any desired fuel amount </li>
      <li>Explore a wide varity of products inside the gas station to look and purchase </li>
      <li>Analyize nearby surroundings and get information as to where it is located </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Audience Characteristics</h2>
    <p>We are targeting two primary audience groups:</p>
    
    <h3>Primary Audience</h3>
    <p>The primary audience would be general customers that can visit the station regularly. They might be interested in quickly finding and selecting their desired gas grade, determining the fuel amount they want to purchase, and possibly locating the station easily.  </p>
    
    <h3>Secondary Audience</h3>
    <p>The secondary audience includes tourists and travelers. Visitors to the area might use the webpage to not only find the gas station but also to explore nearby attractions or points of interest.</p>
    <p>Providing information about the surrounding area could be valuable to this audience group. </p>

    <h2>Competition</h2>
    <p>Examples of two competitor webpages;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.circlek.com/">CircleK</a></li>
        <li>CircleK has a very interactive interface but there is no gas selection option along with different sightseeing and attractions. I did not find anything that related to directions.</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.caseys.com/">Caseys</a></li>
        <li>Caseys has a good interface with product selection and excellent clear photos for the user to see. This is a good example to branch off of.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Test Plan/Get Testy</h1>

    <h2>Validation</h2>
    <p>All HTML pages and CSS pages are all validated through https://validator.w3.org/ and https://jigsaw.w3.org/ and give no errors  </p>

    <h2>Flexibility</h2>
    <p> The website still works when resized but it becomes clunky so I can look into fixing that</p>

    <h2>Speed</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Time to Fist Byte: .787s</p></li>
        <li><p>Start Render: 1.1s</p></li>
        <li><p>First Contentful Paint: 1.122s</p></li>
        <li><p>Speed Index: 1.141s</p></li>
        <li><p>Cumulative Layout Shift: .122 </p></li>
        <li><p>Total Blocking Time: .031s</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>

    <p>Using the accessibility checker provided it clears some tests but I have 4 pages with quality issues, search engine issues, and usability issues </p>
    <p>Regarding the performance summary, I got some issues regarding the quickness, usablility, and being resilient. There is room for improvement</p>
    <p> I also have some issues with minor layout shifts and it takes some time to become interactive so I might have to fix the html format </p>
    
    <h2>Browser Independence</h2>

    <p>Clears on Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Google Chrome.</p>

    <h1>Post-Project Analysis</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><p> I noticed while doing my project, I changed the positioning of my elements a lot as I wanted everything to be in the center of the screen so the user can see clearly</p></li>
        <li><p>I used my skills from other classes to do the JavaScript and also researched more because the features that I had could not be done with only HTML </p></li>
        <li><p>One thing that is a little buggy is the shopping cart that I have. It works fine with the snacks but starts bugging out with the drinks. I tried fixing it but it only made it worse at times. It might be due to my layout.</p></li>

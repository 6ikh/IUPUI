    <h1>CSCI N241 Listless, Joan Rivers </h1>
    
    <h2>Who is Joan Rivers?</h2>
    <p>Joan Alexandra Molinsky (June 8, 1933 - September 4, 2014), known professionally as Joan Rivers, was an American comedian, actress, producer, writer, and television host. </p>
    
    <p>Joan achieved fame for her sharp wit, pioneering stand-up comedy, and groundbreaking work in the male-dominated entertainment industry which increased her popularity. </p>
    
    <p>With a career spanning several decades, Rivers became known for her fearless and irreverent comedic style, hosting <q>The Tonight Show </q> and later <q>Fashion Police </q>, while also pursuing success in acting and writing.</p>
    
    <p>Despite her reputation for sharp and irreverent comedy, Joan Rivers revealed a profound and reflective side with her philosophy that emphasized the significance of living in the present moment.</p>
    
    <h2>Famous Quote:</h2>

    <p> The quote below shows that Joan thought we should enjoy and appreciate the moment we're in, instead of worrying about the past or the future. It's a cool way of saying that every day is a gift, and she lived her life with humor and wisdom, even in tough times:</p> 
    
    <blockquote>Yesterday is history, tommorow is a mystery, today is God's gift, that's why we call it the present. Joan Rivers</blockquote>

    <p> I believe we can relate to her quote as we never know what tomorrow will bring us. God has given us another day to live so we should appreciate it like its a present. </p>

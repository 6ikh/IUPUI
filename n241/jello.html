            <p>I love playing basketball! It's a great way to stay active and competitive. Back in my hometown, Iowa City, I had a basketball hoop on my driveway and would play nearly everyday.</p>
            <p>Now that I have moved here, I do not have a basketball hoop at home but stay active by going to friends' houses along with the gym.</p>

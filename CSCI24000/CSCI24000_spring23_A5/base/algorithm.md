Goals - What is the goal of the program or function?
The goal of this code is to read in lines from a text file "input.txt" and write the output to another file "output.txt". The input file is expected to contain lines with three comma-separated integer values followed by a string label. The output file should print the sum of the 3 integers and the string by the amount of times of that sum. 
Input - What (if any) input does the function or program accept?  Are there specific data types or ranges?
This method accepts as inputs the contents of a text file called "input.txt." A string follows a comma-separated list of three integers on each line of the data in this file, which is divided into multiple lines. The program reads each line of the input file and processes the information to produce the output.
Output - What (if any) output does the function or program return
The output of this code is a text file named "output.txt". This file contains the result of processing each line of the input file "input.txt". For each line in the input file, the code performs the following steps: Parses the line into three comma-separated integer values.
Calculates the sum of the three integer values.Reads the label string that follows the comma-separated values on the same line.Writes the label string to the output file the number of times equal to the sum of the three values.
Steps - What are the steps (written in English) necessary to solve this problem.  This should NOT be programming code, but each line should be specific enough to be translated to a line or two of code in your target language.
Steps for “main.cpp”
The first line of code includes the iostream library which is used for input/output operations in C++.
The second line of code includes the fstream library which is used for file input/output operations in C++.
The third line of code includes the sstream library which is used to process strings as streams.
The fourth line of code includes the string library which is used to handle string data in C++.
The main function starts with the declaration of two file streams, inputF and outputF, used to read data from the file "input.txt" and write data to the file "output.txt".
A string variable "status" is declared to store the input lines read from the file.
The while loop reads lines from the file "input.txt" using the getline() function and stores them in the "status" variable.
Within the while loop, an object of the class istringstream is declared, using the "status" variable as its argument. This is used to break the input line into separate values.
A variable "plus" is declared and initialized to 0 to keep track of the sum of the values read from the input file.
Another string variable "value" is declared to store each value as it is read from the input line.
A for loop is used to read and process three values from the input line. The getline() function is used to read each value and store it in the "value" variable. The atoi() function is used to convert the string value to an integer, which is then added to the "plus" variable.
Another string variable "data" is declared to store the line read from the input file.
Another getline() function call is used to read a line from the input file and store it in the "data" variable.
Another for loop is used to write the "data" value "plus" times to the output file. Within the for loop, the outputF file stream is used to write the "data" value to the file. A conditional statement is used to add a comma after each value, except for the last value.
After the while loop, the close() function is used to close both the input and output files.
The return statement ends the main function and returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.

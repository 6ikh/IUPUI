Goals - What is the goal of the program or function?
The system requires each user to have an account number and PIN, and both checking and savings accounts. The checking account allows deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks, while the savings account has an interest rate that can be calculated for a specific period. Users log in with their account number and PIN and are directed to an admin or user menu. The admin user has specific options, including adding or deleting users, listing all users, applying interest to savings accounts, or exiting. The user menu allows checking balance, depositing or withdrawing from checking or savings accounts, or exiting.
Input - What (if any) input does the function or program accept?  Are there specific data types or ranges?
Normal/ Admin user account number and passwords. Number selections for the menu from the user
Output - What (if any) output does the function or program return
The bank menu with the different selections, practically all features of the bank regarding balance and withdrawal amounts 
Steps - What are the steps (written in English) necessary to solve this problem.This should NOT be programming code, but each line should be specific enough to be translated to a line or two of code in your target language.
Steps for “checking.java” 
Make a public class that will have two private data members for balance and account number. This file will be for storing the amount of money the user wants to put in and take out. 
Steps for “saving.java”
Make a public class that is similar to checking except it will include interest based on what is deposited into the account

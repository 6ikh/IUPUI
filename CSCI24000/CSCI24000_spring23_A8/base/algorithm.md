Goals - What is the goal of the program or function?
The goal of the virtual pet program is to create an interactive simulation of owning and caring for a pet. The program should allow you to create your own unique pet and engage in various activities to keep it healthy and happy. You can also save your pet's progress and pick up where you left off later on. 
Input - What (if any) input does the function or program accept?  Are there specific data types or ranges?
The virtual pet program will accept various types of input from the user, depending on the specific activity being performed. For example, when creating a pet, the user may need to input its name, species, and other characteristics. When interacting with the pet, the user may need to input commands such as "feed" or "play".The specific data types and ranges will depend on the specific attributes and activities of the pet. For example, if the pet has a "hunger" attribute, the user may need to input a value representing how much food to give the pet. Similarly, if the pet has a "health" attribute, the user may need to input a value representing how much exercise to give the pet.
Output - What (if any) output does the function or program return
The virtual pet program may generate various types of output, depending on the specific activity being performed. For example, when the user feeds the pet, the program may output a message indicating how much the pet enjoyed the food and how its "hunger" attribute has been affected.The specific output generated by the program will depend on the specific attributes and activities of the pet, as well as the user's interactions with the pet. The program may also output status updates or messages to the user to indicate the pet's current state and any relevant information.
Steps - What are the steps (written in English) necessary to solve this problem.  This should NOT be programming code, but each line should be specific enough to be translated to a line or two of code in your target language.
Define two abstract data types (ADTs) to represent attributes in general. The adt should represent "meter attributes" (such as hunger or happiness) Create subclasses of the meter attribute ADT and clock attribute ADT to represent specific attributes of the pet, such as "hunger" or "age".Define an abstract pet class that uses the attributes generated in step 2 as data members.Add methods to the pet class that indicate actions the user can take with the pet, such as "feed" or "play".Implement three specific pet classes that inherit from the pet class and add new attributes or behaviors specific to those types of pets.Define a main class that initializes a pet and provides a command-line interface for the user to interact with the pet.Implement an interact class that provides methods to interact with the pet, such as feeding or playing with it, and updates the pet's attributes accordingly.

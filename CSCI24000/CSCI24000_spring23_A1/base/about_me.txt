My name is Parmindar Singh and I am a freshman here at IUPUI. I am in this class because it is required in my degree map as I am a Computer Science major. I have some experince with coding, mostly in python, due to me taking a Computer Science my senior year of highschool.  Something interesting about my self is that I recently moved to the state of Indiana so everything is new to me. My dreams are to have a better understandig of computing and gain enough knowledge to have a well paying job.
